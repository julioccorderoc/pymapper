==============

This module provides a `FieldCache` class to manage path tracking during the data mapping process.
It ensures that each source field is only used once by storing the full source paths that have been matched.

Usage:
------
The `FieldCache` class is intended to be used within a data mapping framework to track and manage
the usage of source fields, ensuring that each field is only used once during the mapping process.
